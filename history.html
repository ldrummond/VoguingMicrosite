			<h1>History</h1>
			<p>
				Inspired by the style of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs and the famous model poses of Vogue magazine, voguing is characterized by model-like poses integrated with angular, linear, and rigid arm, leg, and body movements. This style of dance arose from Harlem ballrooms by African American drag queens of the early 1960s and their tradition in throwing "shade," or a subtle insult directed to other queens in order to impress the judges. It was originally called "presentation" and later "performance". Over the years, the dance evolved into the more intricate and acrobatic form that is now called "vogue".

				The precise origins of voguing are disputed. Although many cite the story in which Paris Dupree takes out a Vogue magazine and mimics the pose at the beat (and other queens subsequently following), there are other accounts that note voguing may have originated from black gay prison inmates of Rikers Island for the attention of other men and throwing shade.

				Voguing is continually developed further as an established dance form that is practiced in the lgbt ballroom scene and clubs in major cities throughout the United States and the around the globeâ€”mainly New York City and Paris.
