			<p>
				The ballroom scene has evolved into a national and international underground dancesport with major balls and dance competitions being held in different regions of the United States and around the world.<br>

				New York State continues to be the mecca of the ballroom scene as well as the dance style, but regional voguing "capitals" exist—Chicago and Detroit for the Midwest. Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Miami for the South. Los Angeles and Las Vegas for the West Coast. Baltimore, D.C, Connecticut, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh. and Virginia for the East Coast.<br>

				International cities in Western Europe (the U.K., France, the Netherlands, and Sweden), Eastern Europe, and Asia Pacific (Japan and New Zealand) have sprouted and held competitions inspired by the voguing from original Balls of New York City.<br>

				Several notable pop celebrities and artists were influenced by Voguing. Beyoncé, Rihanna, Willow Smith, FKA Twigs, Ariana Grande, and Azealia Banks have all taken inspiration from voguing from dances of past and contemporary voguers, while also incorporating the beats traditionally attached to the dance.<br><br>One of the most recent influences of voguing (and Ball culture) comes from the documentary film Kiki, in which contemporary Balls and Voguing is represented through the scenes and styles that now exist.<br>
